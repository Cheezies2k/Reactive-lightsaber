There is a buzzing sound coming from the speaker due to noise through the power. This can be fixed though the use of a 
secondary power supply only for the speaker but I wont implememnt this as the noise can't be heard while the speaker is playing 
sound and the lightsaber will be playing sound constantly

Accelerometer pins might not be grounded but this can easily be fixed through the use of resistors

The spray on frosting isn't the best as it isn't that foggy and chips off when hit. A possible solution would be to use diffusing 
paper inside the tube but I wont implement it as I don't have enough space and the frosting does a good-ish job for now
